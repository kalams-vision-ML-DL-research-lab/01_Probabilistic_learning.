# Probabilistic learnings. 
#This repository is build to understand some probabilistic models (distributions), how probabilistic models helps us in real world descision making problems. 
#repository projects is base on Foundational-Probabilistic-Learning(i.e. Bayesian-Model, Uncertainty Quantification, Distributions). for Real-World "Defence" and "Societal" Predictions.

# Resources: Probability and Statistical Inference(Ninth Edition).
